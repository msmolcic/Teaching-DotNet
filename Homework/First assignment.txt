Assignment:

Create a console application that will allow user to create and store teams of heroes and villains.

1. Create a separate class to communicate with user inputs via console and translate the input commands into application actions.
It must have the following functionalities:

  * Command: '-l' => Try to load the previous state of an application
  * Command: '-s' => Save current changes
  * Command: '-v' => View the list of all characters
  * Command: '-c' => Create character, initializes the character creation flow
  * Command: '-d "CharacterName"' => Delete character by name
  * Command: '-q' => Exit the application

-l => Try to load a list of characters from the JSON file.
-s => Save the current state of the list to the JSON file.
-v => Display the list of currently created characters in the following format:

'Side:'
  - Name {if character has Nickname, also append a.k.a. 'Nickname'} - "Description goes here."

Example:

'Heroes:'
  - Batman a.k.a. 'Batsy' - "Lives in the bat lair with his butler."

'Villains:'
  - Joker - "Crazy clown."

-c => Create a new character. Offer user to enter the following attributes while creating:

  * Name (UNIQUE)
  * Nickname
  * Side (Hero/Villain)
  * Description (Optional) - defaults to "Just another hero/villain." (hero/villain in description should be based on the 'Side' value)

-d "CharacterName" => Delete the character by name.
-q => Check if there are any unsaved changes and offer to user to save them before closing the application. Close the app afterwards no matter the choice.

Note:

  * Characters should be stored in the same data structure in memory, split them to two groups only if user types '-v' command to display the current state of the list.

P.S. - Use NuGet Package Manager for your project to install the Newtonsoft.Json library for easier object (de)serialization.
